# IoT based Smart Posture Detector
A posture detecting system using Arduino UNO and the MPU 9250 9 axis sensor, also linked to a Bluetooth Module and an Android application.


## Overview

Industrialization and urbanization have brought an enormous increase in sedentary lifestyle to the modern world. Indulged in technology, people are often found abandoning their good posture and being hunched over for really long hours. Good posture is of utmost importance for leading a healthy lifestyle.

The aim of this paper is to provide a feasible solution to this problem by presenting a wearable device that recognizes the posture of the person and sends live data on the phone through an app. It records the posture and classifies it as Good, Okay or Bad. It also gives the statistics and overall feedback of how it can be improved.
